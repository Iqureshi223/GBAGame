Movement System

Get movement to be “space like”
Once the button is pressed for (10) or more frames using a counter, up the speed by 1. 
Increase delay more
Once button is no longer pressed, reset current counter back to zero
The max speed will be 3
Once button is no longer pressed, the current movement is stuck until another input
Default velocity is at speed 1 whenever a direction is pressed for that direction

Background

Use space themed tilemap (might need to make manually using pixel image creator software)
deep space purple with stars (will kill spaceship) 
path safe space pink color
Start point will have assembly made “start”
End point will have assembly made “end”

Sprite

spaceship in a top down position
2 or 3 sprites to make illusion of spinning
possible explosion when touch deep space

Mechanics

Single path maze
Needs to get from start to finish
Will teleport back to start if spaceship collides with purple “deep space”
Game ends once spaceship reaches end
